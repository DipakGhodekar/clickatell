h1. Clickatell Ruby API

h1. &#x2192; 'clickatell'


h2. What

A Ruby interface to the Clickatell SMS gateway API.


h2. Installing

<pre>$ sudo gem install clickatell</pre>

h2. The basics

To use this gem, you will need sign up for an account at "the Clickatell website":http://www.clickatell.com. 
Once you are registered and logged into your account centre, you should add 
an HTTP API connection to your account. This will give you your API_ID.

h2. Demonstration of usage

You can now use the library directly. You will need your API_ID as well as your
account username and password.

<pre syntax="ruby">
require 'rubygems'
require 'clickatell'

connection = Clickatell::Connection.new('your_api_id', 'your_username', 'your_password')
connection.send_message('447771234567', 'Hello from clickatell')
</pre>
  
h3. Command-line SMS Utility

The Clickatell gem also comes with a command-line utility that will allow you
to send an SMS directly from the command-line. 

You will need to create a YAML configuration file in your home directory, in a 
file called .clickatell that resembles the following:

<pre>
# ~/.clickatell
api_key: your_api_id
username: your_username
password: your_password
</pre>

You can then use the sms utility to send a message to a single recipient:

<pre>
$ sms 447771234567 'Hello from clickatell'
</pre>
